# Unknown Logger's TODO list

I always like my software to be perfext. Because of this I will check **every** single feature of Unknown Logger and check if it's 
working correctly. I will also add things that aren't working properly and bugs.

## Works
    Time between sending logs
    Can properly compile stubs
    Fake messagebox
    Assembly editor
    Icon editor
    Hide application
    
## Needs to be fixed
    Site visitor (need to pass the URL to the stub builder and add it when it compiles a new stub)
    Encrypter (Still need to fully implement it but I might not do it because then the application may get used for malicious purposes.)
    
## Needs to be checked if working properly
    Disable CMD
    Disable control panel
    Respawner
    Site visitor
    Download and execute
    Disable UAC
    Disable taskmanager
    Take screenshots
    Delete Chrome and Firefox data
    Add application to startup
    File Binder
    
## To be added 
    Nice keystroke formatting
